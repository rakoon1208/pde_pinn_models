# Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) Models for Solving Various Non-Linear PDEs (W.I.P)

This project implements Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving and approximating solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations using TensorFlow 2.x. PINNs leverage both data and the underlying physics of the problem, enforcing partial differential equations (PDEs) as soft constraints during training.

## Features (W.I.P)
- Implementation of a neural network framework for solving forward and inverse problems involving nonlinear PDEs.
- Compatible with TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring modern and efficient execution.
